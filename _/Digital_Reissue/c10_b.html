      <p>
      The sun was beginning to set when Hazel woke to</br>
      see Acorn listening and sniffing in the silence,</br>
      between two white-skinned flints. The light was</br>
      thicker, the breeze had dropped and the beans</br>
      were still.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Pipkin was stretched out a little way away. A</br>
      yellow-and-black burying beetle, crawling across</br>
      the white fur of his belly, stopped, waved its short,</br>
      curved antennae and then moved on again.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Hazel grew tense with sudden misgiving. He knew</br>
      that these beetles come to dead bodies, on which they</br>
      feed and lay their eggs. They will dig away the earth</br>
      from under the bodies of small creatures, such as</br>
      shrew mice and fallen fledglings, and then lay their</br>
      eggs on them before covering them with soil.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Surely Pipkin could not have died in his sleep? Hazel</br>
      sat up quickly. Acorn started and turned toward him</br>
      and the beetle scurried away over the pebbles as Pipkin</br>
      moved and woke.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      The next moment all the rabbits leaped up in panic.</br>
      From close at hand the sound of a shot tore across the</br>
      fields. A peewit rose screaming. The echoes came back</br>
      in waves, like a pebble rolling round a box, and from</br>
      the wood across the river came the clattering of wood</br>
      pigeons' wings among the branches.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      In an instant the rabbits were running in all directions </br>
      through the bean rows, each one tearing by instinct</br>
      toward holes that were not there. Hazel stopped short on</br>
      the edge of the beans. Looking about him, he could see</br>
      none of the others.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      He waited, trembling, for the next shot: but there was</br>
      silence. Then he felt, vibrating along the ground, the</br>
      steady tread of a man going away beyond the crest over</br>which they had come that morning. At that moment Silver</br>
      appeared, pushing his way through the plants close by.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      The other rabbits were beginning to reach the hedge as</br>
      Bigwig hopped down the bank and crouched on the verge</br>
      of the road. From beyond the bend came the sound of</br>
      another approaching car. Hazel and Silver watched tensely.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      The car appeared, flashing green and white, and raced</br>
      down toward Bigwig. For an instant it filled the whole</br>
      world with noise and fear. Then it was gone and Bigwig's</br>
      fur was blowing in the whack of wind that followed it</br>
      down the hedges.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      He jumped back up the bank among the staring rabbits.</br>
      "See? They don't hurt you," said Bigwig. "As a matter of</br>
      fact, I don't think they're alive at all. But I must</br>
      admit I can't altogether make it out."</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      As on the riverbank, Blackberry had moved away and was</br>
      already down on the road on his own account, sniffing</br>
      out toward the middle, halfway between Hazel and the bend.</br>
      They saw him start and jump back to the shelter of the bank.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      "What is it?" said Hazel. Blackberry did not answer,</br>
      and Hazel and Bigwig hopped toward him along the verge.</br>
      He was opening and shutting his mouth and licking his</br>
      lips, much as a cat does when something disgusts it.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      "You say they're not dangerous, Bigwig," he said</br>
      quietly."But I think they must be, for all that." In</br>
      the middle of the road was a flattened, bloody mass</br>
      of brown prickles and white fur, with small black feet</br>
      and snout crushed round the edges.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      The flies crawled upon it, and here and there the sharp</br>
      points of gravel pressed up through the flesh.</br>
