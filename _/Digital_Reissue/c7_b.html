      Hazel came out on the further side of the ilexes</br>
      and followed the path round a bend. Then he stopped</br>
      dead and sat back on his haunches. Immediately in</br>
      front of him, Bigwig and Dandelion were staring out</br>
      from the sheer edge of a high bank, and below the</br>
      bank ran a stream.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      It was in fact the little river Enborne, twelve</br>
      to fifteen feet wide and at this time of year two</br>
      or three feet deep with spring rain, but to the</br>
      rabbits it seemed immense, such a river as they had</br>
      never imagined.</br>
      </br>
      </br>


      The moon had almost set and the night was now</br>
      dark, but they could see the water faintly shining as</br>
      it flowed and could just make out, on the further</br>
      side, a thin belt of nut trees and alders. Somewhere</br>
      beyond, a plover called three or four times and was silent.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      One by one, most of the others came up, stopped</br>
      at the bank and looked at the water without speaking. A</br>
      chilly breeze was moving and several of them</br>
      trembled where they sat. "Well, this is a nice</br>
      surprise, Hazel," said Bigwig at length. "Or were you</br>
      expecting this when you took us into the wood?"</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      Hazel realized wearily that Bigwig was probably</br>
      going to be troublesome. He was certainly no coward,</br>
      but he was likely to remain steady only as long as he</br>
	  could see his way clear and be sure of what to do.</br>
	  </br>
	  </br>

	  To him, perplexity was worse than danger; and when he</br>
	  was perplexed he usually grew angry. The day before,</br>
	  Fiver's warning had troubled him, and he had spoken in</br>
	  anger to the Threarah and left the Owsla.</br>
	  </br>
      </br>

      Then, while he was in an uncertain mood about the idea</br>
      of leaving the warren, Captain Holly had appeared in</br>
      capital time to be attacked and to provide a perfect</br>
      reason for their departure.</br>

      Now, at the sight of the river, Bigwig's assurance was</br>
      leaking again and unless he, Hazel, could restore it in</br>
      some way, they were likely to be in for trouble. He</br>
      thought of the Threarah and his wily courtesy.</br>

      </br>
      </br>

      "I don't know what we should have done without you just</br>
      now, Bigwig," he said. "What was that animal? Would it</br>
      have killed us?" "A lendri," said Bigwig. "I've heard about</br>
      them in the Owsla. They're not really dangerous.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      They can't catch a rabbit that runs, and nearly always</br>
      you can smell them coming. They're funny things: I've</br>
      heard of rabbits living almost on top of them and coming</br>
      to no harm. But they're best avoided, all the same.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      They'll dig out rabbit kittens and they'll kill an</br>
      injured rabbit if they find one. They're one of the</br>
      Thousand, all right. I ought to have guessed from the</br>
      smell, but it was new to me."</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      "It had killed before it met us," said Blackberry with</br>
      a shudder. "I saw the blood on its lips." "A rat,</br>
      perhaps, or pheasant chicks. Lucky for us it had killed,</br>
      otherwise it might have been quicker. Still, fortunately</br>
      we did the right thing. We really came out of it very well,"</br>
      said Bigwig.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      Fiver came limping down the path with Pipkin. They,</br>
      too, checked and stared at the sight of the river. "What</br>
      do you think we ought to do now, Fiver?" asked Hazel.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

	  Fiver looked down at the water and twitched his ears. "We</br>
	  shall have to cross it," he said. "But I don't think I</br>
	  can swim, Hazel. I'm worn out, and Pipkin's a good deal</br>
	  worse than I am."</br>
	  </br>
	  </br>

	  "Cross it?" cried Bigwig. "Cross it? Who's going to cross</br>
	  it? What do you want to cross it for? I never heard such</br>
	  nonsense." Like all wild animals, rabbits can swim if they</br>
	  have to; and some even swim when it suits them.</br>
	  </br>
	  </br>

	  Rabbits have been known to live on the edge of a wood and</br>
	  regularly swim a brook to feed in the fields beyond. But</br>
	  most rabbits avoid swimming, and certainly an exhausted</br>
	  rabbit could not swim the Enborne.</br>

	  </br>
	  </br>
	  "I don't want to jump in there," said Speedwell. "Why not</br>
	  just go along the bank?" asked Hawkbit. Hazel suspected</br>
	  that if Fiver felt they ought to cross the river, it might be</br>
	  dangerous not to. But how were the others to be persuaded?</br>
	  </br>
	  </br>

	  At this moment, as he was still wondering what to say to</br>
	  them, he suddenly realized that something had lightened his</br>
	  spirits. What could it be? A smell? A sound? Then he knew.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

	  Nearby, across the river, a lark had begun to twitter and</br>
	  climb. It was morning. A blackbird called one or two deep,</br>
      slow notes and was followed by a wood pigeon. Soon they</br>
	  were in a gray twilight and could see that the stream</br>
	  bordered the further edge of the wood. On the other side</br>
	  lay open fields.</br>
