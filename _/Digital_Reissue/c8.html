      The top of the sandy bank was a good six feet</br>
      above the water. From where they sat, the</br>
      rabbits could look straight ahead upstream,</br>
      and downstream to their left.</br>

      </br>
      </br>
      Evidently there were nesting holes in the sheer</br>
      face below them, for as the light grew they</br>
      saw three or four martins dart out over the stream</br>
      and away into the fields beyond.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      In a short time one returned with his beak full,</br>
      and they could hear the nestlings squeaking as he</br>
      flew out of sight beneath their feet. The bank</br>
      did not extend far in either direction.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      Upstream, it sloped down to a grassy path</br>
      between the trees and the water. This followed the</br>
      line of the river, which ran straight from almost</br>
      as far away as they could see, flowing smoothly</br>
      without fords, gravel shallows or plank bridges.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      Immediately below them lay a wide pool and here the</br>
      water was almost still. Away to their left, the</br>
      bank sloped down again into clumps of alder, among</br>
      which the stream could be heard chattering over gravel.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      There was a glimpse of barbed wire stretched across</br>
      the water and they guessed that this must surround a</br>
      cattle wade, like the one in the little brook near the</br>
      home warren.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      Hazel looked at the path upstream. "There's grass</br>
      down there," he said. "Let's go and feed." They</br>
      scrambled down the bank and set to nibbling beside</br>
      the water.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Between them and the stream itself stood half-grown</br>
      clumps of purple loosestrife and fleabane, which</br>
      would not flower for nearly two months yet. The only</br>
      blooms were a few early meadowsweet and a patch of</br>
      pink butterbur.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Looking back at the face of the bank, they could see</br>
      that it was in fact dotted thickly with martins' holes.</br>
      Hazel moved close to Fiver and quietly edged him away</br>
      from the others, feeding as he went.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      When they were a little way off, and half concealed by</br>
      a patch of reeds, he said, "Are you sure we've got to</br>
      cross the river, Fiver? What about going along the bank</br>
      one way or the other?"</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      "No, we need to cross the river, Hazel, so that we can</br>
      get into those fields -- and on beyond them too. I</br>
      know what we ought to be looking for -- a high, lonely</br>
      place with dry soil, where rabbits can see and hear all</br>
      round and men hardly ever come.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Wouldn't that be worth a journey?" "Yes, of course it</br>
      would. But is there such a place?" "Not near a river --</br>
      I needn't tell you that. But if you cross a river you</br>
      start going up again, don't you?</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      We ought to be on the top -- on the top and in the open."</br>
      "But, Fiver, I think they may refuse to go much further.</br>
      And then again, you say all this and yet you say you're</br>
      too tired to swim?" "I can rest, Hazel, but Pipkin's in a pretty bad way. I think he's injured.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      We may have to stay here half the day." "Well, let's go</br>
      and talk to the others. They may not mind staying. It's</br> crossing they're not going to fancy, unless something</br> frightens them into it."</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Looking round for Blackberry, he saw that he had left</br>
      them and was up at the top of the pool, where the narrow</br>
      beach tailed away into a gravel spit. His paws were half</br> buried in the wet gravel and he was nosing at something</br>large and flat on the waterline. It looked like a piece</br>
      of wood.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Blackberry buried his nose in the gravel under the</br>
      landward edge of the board and raised it, pushing. The</br>
      board tipped. Pipkin squealed and Fiver lowered his</br>
      head and splayed his claws.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Then the board righted itself and drifted out a few</br>
      feet into the pool with the two rabbits hunched upon it,</br>
      rigid and motionless. It rotated slowly and they found</br> themselves staring back at their comrades.</br>
      </br>
