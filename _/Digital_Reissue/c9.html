      The sun rose while they were still lying in the</br>
      thorn. Already several of the rabbits were asleep,</br>
      crouched uneasily between the thick stems, aware</br>
      of the chance of danger but too tired to do more than</br>
      trust to luck.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Hazel, looking at them, felt almost as insecure as</br>
      he had on the riverbank. A hedgerow in open fields was</br>
      no place to remain all day. But where could they go?</br>
      He needed to know more about their surroundings.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      He moved along the hedge, feeling the breeze from the</br>
      south and looking for some spot where he could sit</br>
      and scent it without too much risk. The smells that came</br>
      down from the higher ground might tell him something.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Hazel squatted on his haunches and stared at the</br>
      orderly forest of small, glaucous trees with their</br>
      columns of black-and-white bloom. He had never seen</br>
      anything like this.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Wheat and barley he knew, and once he had been in a</br>
      field of turnips. But this was entirely different from</br>
      any of those and seemed, somehow, attractive, wholesome,</br>
      propitious. True, rabbits could not eat these plants: he</br>
      could smell that.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      But they could lie safely among them for as long as</br>
      they liked, and they could move through them easily and</br>
      unseen. Hazel determined then and there to bring the</br>
      rabbits up to the beanfield to shelter and rest until</br>
      the evening.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      He ran back and found the others where he had left them.</br>
      Bigwig and Silver were awake, but all the rest were</br>
      still napping uneasily. They became widely separated as</br>
      they straggled up the slope. Silver and Bigwig led the</br>
      way, with Hazel and Buckthorn a short distance behind.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      The rest idled along, hopping a few yards and then</br>
      pausing to nibble or to pass droppings on the warm,</br>
      sunny grass. Silver was almost at the crest when suddenly,</br>
      from halfway up, there came a high screaming --</br>
      the sound a rabbit makes, not to call for help or to</br>
      frighten an enemy, but simply out of terror.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Fiver and Pipkin, limping behind the others, and</br>
      conspicuously undersized and tired, were being attacked</br>
      by the crow. It had flown low along the ground. Then,</br>
      pouncing, it had aimed a blow of its great bill at</br>
      Fiver, who just managed to dodge in time.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      At the top of the slope Buckthorn was already leading</br>
      the way into the beanfield. Hazel reached the hedge,</br>
      crossed a narrow turf verge on the other side and</br>
      found himself looking straight down a long, shadowy</br>
      aisle between two rows of beans.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      The earth was soft and crumbling, with a scattering</br>
      of the weeds that are found in cultivated fields --</br>
      fumitory, charlock, pimpernel and mayweed, all growing</br>
      in the green gloom under the bean leaves.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      As the plants moved in the breeze, the sunlight</br>
      dappled and speckled back and forth over the brown</br>
      soil, the white pebbles and weeds. Yet in this</br>
      ubiquitous restlessness there was nothing alarming, for</br>
      the whole forest took part in it and the only sound</br>
      was the soft, steady movement of the leaves.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      Far along the bean row Hazel glimpsed Buckthorn's back</br>
      and followed him into the depths of the field. Soon</br>
      after, all the rabbits had come together in a kind of</br>
      hollow. Far around, on all sides, stood the orderly rows</br>
      of beans, securing them against hostile approach, roofing</br>
      them over and covering their scent.</br>
      </br>
      </br>
      They could hardly have been safer underground. Even a</br>
      little food could be had at a pinch, for here and there</br>
      were a few pale twists of grass and here and there a</br>
      dandelion.</br>
      </br>
      </br>

      "We can sleep here all day," said Hazel. "But I</br>
      suppose one of us ought to stay awake; and if I take</br>
      the first turn it'll give me a chance to have a look at</br>
      your paw, Hlao-roo. I think you've got something in it."</br>
      </br>
      </br>
